# 1inch Fusion Implementation Status

## Current Implementation

The StellHydra bridge has been enhanced with 1inch Fusion API integration. However, there are important limitations to understand:

### Key Findings

1. **1inch Fusion vs Fusion+**:

    - 1inch Fusion is the current API that supports gasless swaps on the same chain
    - Fusion+ (cross-chain) is not yet publicly available through the API
    - The endpoint `/fusion-plus/orders/v1.0/route-optimization` does not exist

2. **Current Limitations**:
    - **No Cross-Chain Support**: 1inch Fusion only supports swaps on the same blockchain
    - **Limited Chain Support**: Only major EVM chains are supported (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)
    - **Stellar Not Supported**: Stellar is not supported by 1inch Fusion

### What Works

1. **Same-Chain Swaps**: If both source and destination tokens are on the same chain (e.g., ETH to USDC on Ethereum), Fusion can be used
2. **Gasless Transactions**: Users don't pay gas fees for Fusion swaps
3. **MEV Protection**: Fusion provides protection against sandwich attacks

### Implementation Details

1. **API Endpoints Updated**:

    - Changed from non-existent `fusion-plus` endpoints to working `fusion` endpoints
    - Added token address resolution for common tokens (ETH, USDC, etc.)
    - Added proper error handling for cross-chain requests

2. **Frontend Updates**:
    - Enhanced error messages to explain why Fusion isn't available
    - Automatic fallback to StellHydra for cross-chain swaps
    - Clear messaging about Fusion limitations

### How to Test Fusion

To test 1inch Fusion (same-chain swaps only):

1. Select the same chain for both source and destination (e.g., Ethereum → Ethereum)
2. Choose tokens on that chain (e.g., ETH → USDC)
3. The system will attempt to use Fusion for gasless swaps

### How Cross-Chain Works

For cross-chain swaps (e.g., Stellar → Ethereum):

1. The system automatically detects cross-chain requests
2. Falls back to StellHydra bridge (the original implementation)
3. Shows appropriate message: "1inch Fusion does not support cross-chain swaps - using StellHydra bridge"

### Future Enhancements

When 1inch releases Fusion+ API for cross-chain swaps:

1. Update API endpoints to use new Fusion+ endpoints
2. Remove cross-chain limitations
3. Enable full cross-chain swap functionality

### Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:

```bash
FUSION_API_KEY=your-1inch-api-key
VITE_FUSION_API_KEY=your-1inch-api-key
```

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to optimize Fusion route"**: Usually means trying to do cross-chain swap
2. **"Chain not supported by Fusion"**: The selected chain isn't supported by 1inch
3. **404 Errors**: The Fusion+ endpoints don't exist yet - system will fallback to StellHydra

### Architecture

```
User Request
    ↓
Check if Cross-Chain
    ↓
If Same-Chain & Supported → Try 1inch Fusion
    ↓ (if fails)
Fallback to StellHydra Bridge
```

This implementation provides a robust foundation that will seamlessly support Fusion+ when it becomes available.
